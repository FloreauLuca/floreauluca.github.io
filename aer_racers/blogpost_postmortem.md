#Blog Import Unity Scene into Engine C++

## Introduction

### Context

During my third year of Bachelor in Game Programming at the SAE Institute, we had objectives to set up a specialization project aiming to put into practice what we had learned and to develop our skills in the fields of our future jobs.

### Instructions

This project took place over 8 months from September to April 2021.

Our project was to create a racing game on Switch in local multiplayer.

For this, we had to use the [NekoEngine](https://github.com/EliasFarhan/NekoEngine/tree/develop), a custom game engine developed in C++ by Elias Farhan. It is an engine based on the ECS system. It uses the OpenGL, SDL2, and EasyProfiler libraries.

### Team

For the implementation of the project we were 5 programmers: 
- Sebastien Feser, Project Leader, Lead Designer, and Lead Game, 
- Stephen Grosjean Dev Ops, 
- Simon Canas Lead Engine Prog 
- Dylan Von Arx Lead Tool who left in January
- me, Luca Floreau, Producer and Lead Programmer

### My Roles

As Producer, I was in charge of the planning.

As Lead Programmer, I was in charge of the distribution and the progress of the tasks.

Finally, I also took care of the Engine and Game tasks according to the needs of each team.

## Project

So we decided to start on a pod racing game inspired by Star Wars Pod Racer.

For the artistic direction, we received concept arts from Nicolas Vallée inspired by Porco Rosso. However, following a lack of communication of our art, we have some misunderstandings concerning the concept art produced.
