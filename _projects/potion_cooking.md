# Context
During **my first year of Bachelor in Games Programming** and as part of the **module of Unity basics**, I was asked to create a **full game in Unity**.

# Pitch
In a medieval fantasy world, there is, at the bottom of a forest, a **magic fast-potion stand**. Customers come to ask for a magic potion and they are served in the shortest time.

You play as **the potion-making sorcerer**. You are therefore requested to **welcome** the customers, **choose the ingredients**, **manage the cooking**, **fill the containers** and then **serve the clients**.

For this, you have access to 4 windows: Ingredient, Cooking, Preparation, and Reception.

Customers have a **waiting limit** before they get angry and leave.

# Realization
I first work on the **camera** of the game allowing the player to switch between each step of the preparation.

Then, I developed a **Dragâ€™n Drop System** to manipulate brewing ingredients.

The next step was to developed the **interaction between each object**. To manage the recipe, I use **ScriptableObject**.

Finally, I had time to add some **signs and feedback** for the cooking and the customer.

I also create **all the graphism** allowing me to practice using **Illustrator**.

# Learned Skills
It allows me to practice in Unity and **discover a lot of mechanics**.

This project taught me **why and how to use the ScriptableObjects**.

Finally, it was **my first game on mobile** allowing me to learn a lot about **Android development in Unity**.


# Result
