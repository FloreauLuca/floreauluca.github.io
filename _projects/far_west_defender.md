# Context
During the Isart Summer Camp for learning 2D development, I learn to develop a tower defense in Construct 2 in 2 weeks. It was my first real game.

# Pitch
You have to buy cowboys to defend your train against Mexican.
It’s a basic tower defense with multiple types of towers and multiple upgrades for towers.

# Réalisation
I first develop the tower aiming and shooting.
Then I develop the tower spawning and upgrading.
Finally, I create the enemies spawning and move.

I also create all the graphism learning to use Illustrator.

# Learned Skills
Since it is my first game, I learn all about Illustrator and Construct 2.
I also learn a lot about the basics of game development and the basics of tower defense.

# Result
Play on itch
