# Context
For the first MizJam, I had to create a game in 48 hours using an imposed asset pack from Kenney.

# Pitch
- Embody an enchanted spring around a level to collect treasure and grab the king's crown.
- Drag and drop to bounce across the level

# Realization
The first step was to develop the controls. I developed a system of point’n click allowing the game to be playable on PC and mobile. Then, I did a lot of adjustments in the movement to obtain a good feel with the bounce.
As I didn’t have a lot of mechanics, I had time to work on juiciness for the score incrementation, particles, sound, respawn effect, etc... 


# Learned Skills
Thanks to the simple gameplay, I had time to test and learn a lot about all types of juicy integration.
I also appreciate working with imposed assets leaving time on other thing and allowing to obtain a more coherent artistic direction.

# Result

Play on itch
