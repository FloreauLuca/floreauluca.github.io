# Context
During the SAE Spring Jam, I work with 1 programmer and 2 artists to create again 48 hours answering the theme “Don't stop moving!”

# Pitch
The Unstoppable Mr.Starr is a rodeo game where you need to survive against cowboys, hummers, and giant cows. Drive fast to recover your life.

# Réalisation
I work on the spawning of enemies in different waves.
I also work on car movement and its collision with other objects.
Finally, I managed the UI integration.

# Learned Skills
I learn a lot working with 3D artists and 3D animation in FBX models.

# Result :
Play on itch
