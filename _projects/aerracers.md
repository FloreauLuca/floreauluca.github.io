# Contexe
During my third year of Bachelor in Game Programming at the SAE Institute, we had objectives to set up a specialization project aiming to put into practice what we had learned and to develop our skills in the fields of our future jobs.
Instructions
This project took place over 8 months from September to April 2021.

Our project was to create a racing game on Switch in local multiplayer.

For this, we had to use the NekoEngine, a custom game engine developed in C++ by Elias Farhan. It is an engine based on the ECS system. It uses the OpenGL, SDL2, and EasyProfiler libraries.

# Pitch
AerRacers is a local multi-player pod racing game running on Nintendo Switch.

# Roles
For the implementation of the project we were 5 programmers:

Sebastien Feser, Project Leader, Lead Designer, and Lead Game,
Stephen Grosjean Dev Ops,
Simon Canas Lead Engine Prog
Dylan Von Arx Lead Tool who left in January
me, Luca Floreau, Producer and Lead Programmer

My Roles

As Producer, I was in charge of the planning.

As Lead Programmer, I was in charge of the distribution and the progress of the tasks.

Finally, I also took care of the Engine and Game tasks according to the needs of each team.
