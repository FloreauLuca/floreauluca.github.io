# Context
During the **Isart Summer Camp** for **learning 2D video game development**, I learn to develop a **tower defense in Construct 2 in 2 weeks**. It was my first real game.

# Pitch
You have to **buy cowboys** to **defend your train** against **Mexicans**.

Itâ€™s a basic tower defense with **multiple types of towers** and **multiple upgrades for towers**.

# Realization
I first develop the **tower aiming and shooting**.

Then I develop the **tower spawning and upgrading**.

Finally, I create the **enemies spawning and move**.

I also create **all the graphism** learning to use **Illustrator**.

# Learned Skills
Since it is my first game, I learn all about **Illustrator and Construct 2**.

I also learn a lot about the **basics of game development** and the **basics of tower defense**.

# Result
