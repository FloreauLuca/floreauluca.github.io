#Blog Import Unity Scene into Engine C++

## Introduction

### Context

During my third year of Bachelor in Game Programming at the SAE Institute, we had objectives to set up a specialization project aiming to put into practice what we had learned and to develop our skills in the fields of our future jobs.

### Instructions

This project took place over 8 months from September to April 2021.

Our project was to create a racing game on Switch in local multiplayer.

For this, we had to use the [NekoEngine](https://github.com/EliasFarhan/NekoEngine/tree/develop), a custom game engine developed in C++ by Elias Farhan. It is an engine based on the ECS system. It uses the OpenGL, SDL2, and EasyProfiler libraries.

### Team

For the implementation of the project we were 5 programmers: 
- Sebastien Feser, Project Leader, Lead Designer, and Lead Game, 
- Stephen Grosjean Dev Ops, 
- Simon Canas Lead Engine Prog 
- Dylan Von Arx Lead Tool who left in January
- me, Luca Floreau, Producer and Lead Programmer

### My Roles

As Producer, I was in charge of the planning.

As Lead Programmer, I was in charge of the distribution and the progress of the tasks.

Finally, I also took care of the Engine and Game tasks according to the needs of each team.

## Project

So we decided to start on a pod racing game inspired by Star Wars Pod Racer.

For the artistic direction, we received concept arts from Nicolas Vallée inspired by Porco Rosso. However, following a lack of communication of our art, we have some misunderstandings concerning the concept art produced.

During the production, we welcomed several teams to help us.

First of all, we welcomed the second-year Games Programmer as part of their Tool Production modules. They produced tools on Unity and Neko to help us in the production of our project.

Next, we welcomed the second-year Game Artist for the production of graphic models. They used Nicolas Vallée's concept art to produce the environment, the ships, and the totems.

We also welcomed the second-year Audio Designer for the production of the sound effects. We also used the production of Leo for the music of the game.
