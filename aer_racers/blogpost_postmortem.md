#Blog Import Unity Scene into Engine C++

## Introduction

### Context

During my third year of Bachelor in Game Programming at the SAE Institute, we had objectives to set up a specialization project aiming to put into practice what we had learned and to develop our skills in the fields of our future jobs.

### Instructions

This project took place over 8 months from September to April 2021.

Our project was to create a racing game on Switch in local multiplayer.

For this, we had to use the [NekoEngine](https://github.com/EliasFarhan/NekoEngine/tree/develop), a custom game engine developed in C++ by Elias Farhan. It is an engine based on the ECS system. It uses the OpenGL, SDL2, and EasyProfiler libraries.
